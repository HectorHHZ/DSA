# Data Structure and Algorithm

This course is offered by NYU Tandon school of Eningeering. I took this course at 2021 Fall semester with `Liu Yong` as the instructor. This course has the same schedule and course materials as the MIT advanced data structure. I post all the course materials and exam paper to this repository.



##Tentative Schedule 

• Week 1: Introduction to algorithm: correctness and performance. Best-, worst-,
and average-case performance. Asymptotic notation: big-O, big-Ω, and big-Θ;
little-o, and little-ω. 
• Week 2: Recurrence and solving methods: iteration, substitution and master
theorem
• Week 3: Divide and conquer algorithms, introduction to sorting: insertion sort,
bubble sort
• Week 4: Sorting: MergeSort, Heap and HeapSort, 
• Week 5: Sorting: quick sort, randomized algorithms, lower bound for comparison
sorting, counting sort and radix sort, order statistics and selection
• Week 6: Hashing and Universal Hashing, Binary search trees 
• Week 7: Binary search trees (cont.d), midterm review
• Week 8: Midterm Exam
• Week 9: Graph basics, Breath-First Search, Depth-First Search
• Week 10: Directed-acyclic graph and topological ordering, strongly connected
components, 
• Week 11: Intro to dynamic programming, greedy algorithm
• Week 12: Greedy algorithm, Huffman coding, Minimum Spanning Tree
• Week 13: Single-source shortest paths, all-pairs shortest paths
• Week 14: NP-Completeness and Final Review
• Week 15: Final Exam



## Commit

Great professor and well scheduled lectures. 12 Assignments help you get more familiar with the concepts. Great mid/final exam papers combining easy questions(Basic concepts) and extremly difficult questions together(eg: Dynammic Programming, graphic data structure proof, analysis of new data structure). 

All the algorithm and code are `pseudocode`. Personally, I think this course will be better to reduce the assignments and replace them to Java implementation/LAB of the data structure. 

## Final Grade 

Only 10% student get A in Liu Yong's course.
